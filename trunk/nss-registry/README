In order to get this working you have to do x things:
Configure using ./configure (enable debug, if desired, with --enable-debug)
make to Compile the package
make install to install the module and the passwdconvert program. (Module should be installed in /lib
Run passwdconvert to convert passwd, shadow and group database to registry.
Note that if you previously converted the database with the 0.1 version 
of the tool, you MUST convert again with this tool. 
Else all the get??uid/getgrgid functions will not work.
Once the installation and conversion is over you need to change your nsswitch.conf
to tell it to use the registry database.
you do this by change the lines to what is below:
passwd: elektra
group: elektra
shadow: elektra

(Most likely it will say either files or compat in your existing file)
After this a restart of any services that retrieve database information is required (i.e. sshd, ftpd etc)
Bugs can be reported to rayman@skumler.net or the help forum at 
the nss-registry project page at developer.berlios.de.
